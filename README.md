# express-chatrooms
:squirrel: My simple chat application with local, google, github single sign on; was a fork of sahat/hackathon-starter. Note: Since its currently usable and pretty secure over HTTPS, I'm slowed down the dev on this project.

### Demo

    Sorry the demo is no longer running. Feel free to clone/fork/pull request as you desire.
    I will update dependencies and stuff occasionally possibly the code base as time permits.
    
### Getting it running...

    sudo apt install mongodb
    npm install
    node app.js
    
- [x] Get OAuth API keys.
- [x] Use only local mongodb accounts if you wish.
- [x] Destroy any chatroom at any time.
- [ ] Some unknown thing that might be in the code somewhere.
- [x] Ajax driven, magically the textbox keeps going.
- [x] If you press destroy, you destroy the logs in everyone elses browser too.
